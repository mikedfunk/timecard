# Timecard

Submits the timecard at my company.

## Setup

Do you work at the same place? ;)

* copy `config.dist.json` to `config.json` and fill in fields
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `npm run selenium` to start the selenium server
* `npm run timecard` to run the timecard script (currently pauses at the end)
